# Mixdown.js

Mixdown is a plugin based approach to application development.  Mixdown started as a way to manage literally hundreds of websites in a small number of processes.  

* Rich configuration interface for dependency injection.  
* Plugins are preferred over middleware, though existing connect/express middleware can be used.  (Utilizes [broadway](https://github.com/flatiron/broadway) for plugin patterns)
* Logging is provided by [bucker](https://github.com/nlf/bucker), your logger configuration in mixdown.json will be used as the options to initialize bucker.  We use syslog in production and console transports for dev.
* Distributed configuration (store your sites plugin properties anywhere) with hot-reload is first class citizen.  Default provider is file system for simple installs.  CouchDB and Zoo Keeper are available for complex multi-site deployments.


# Production Ready

Production ready components are built in.

* Logging
* Web server with tcp and socket transports
* Interfaces for http, https, and cli
* Scalable & clustered workers (mixdown exclusive: solved the worker load balance bug in 0.10.x)
* Distributed config with hot reload

** We use it to build web apps. **

** We use it to build distributed, fault tolerant systems of real time workers. **

# Quick Start

There are 2 supported yeoman generators for mixdown:

## [Mixdown Web App Scaffold](https://github.com/mixdown/generator-mixdown)

```
$ npm i yo generator-mixdown -g
$ mkdir wobble
$ cd wobble
$ yo mixdown

# follow the prompts

$ npm start

# navigate to http://localhost:8081

```

Once you have an existing mixdown app, you can add a new http route like this:

```
$ yo mixdown:route

```


## [Mixdown CLI/Worker Scaffold](https://github.com/mixdown/generator-mixdown-cli)

```
$ npm i yo generator-mixdown-cli -g
$ mkdir wibble
$ cd wibble
$ yo mixdown-cli

# follow the prompts

$ npm start

# App will start, show your services, then stop b/c the work is done.

```


# Plugins

Mixdown uses [Broadway](https://github.com/flatiron/broadway) for the plugin interface.  It adds a declarative composable layer to your application (web, cli, whatever) to encourage these principles:

* Single-use and isomorphoic plugins/components
* Simple declarative design for plugin activation and dependency injection
* An app is a core thing (web server for example) that you decorate with functionality
* With a robust and simple pattern for decorating your app, you can develop much better code, much more quickly, and without refactoring.

# Remix over Refactor

Taking this a step further, loads of time has been wasted in software development re-factoring.  No one likes re-factoring.  Mixdown prefers re-mixing over re-factoring.  Here is the concept.

* Use plugins that do 1 thing very well (ex: queries a noSQL, renders a view)
* Decorate your app with them
* When you need to add, remove, or swap something then simply swap the plugin.  

# Anatomy of a Mixdown app

Example of some things you want in a web app. (shown in a mixdown configuration)

```javascript 
{
  "id": "wobble",

  "plugins": {

  	"render": {
      "module": "broadway-handlebars",
      "options": {
        "optimize": false,
        "development": true,
        "view": {
          "base": [
            "./views"
          ],
          "ext": "html"
        }
      }
    },

    "json": {
      "module": "mixdown-json",
      "options": {
        "jsonpEnabled": true
      }
    },

    "error": {
      "module": "mixdown-error"
    }
  }
}

```

The above configuration will yield an app with an id of "wobble" which is has the ability to render html using handlebars, stream json objects from the server, and return standard error responses to clients.

In a web app, you need a router so that you can interpret routes.  The [mixdown-router](https://github.com/mixdown/router) plugin allows you to declare a route table and map controllers.

If we added the following plugin config, now we have a a home page route defined which we can handle requests.

```javascript 

"router": {
  "module": "./router/router.js",
  "options": {
    "routes": {

    	"home": {
        "method": "GET",
        "name": "home",
        "path": "/",
        "description": "Home Page",
        "handler": "home",
        "params": {},
        "enabled": true
      }

    }
  }

```

The corresponding code to handle the request is neatly tucked away in its own file.  It looks like this:

```javascript

module.exports = function(httpContext) {
  var app = httpContext.app;
  var res = httpContext.response;

  // Get a view model, this is would typically come from a database or service.  
  var viewModel = {
  	title: 'Hello',
  	query: httpContext.url.query
  };

  // Pass the view model to the render function which knows how to fine the file "home.html" on the file system.
  app.plugins.render('home', viewModel, function(err, html) {

    if (err) {
      app.plugins.error.notFound(err, res);
      return;
    }

    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    res.end(html);

  });

};

```
